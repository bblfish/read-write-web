0. download code using mercurial, and switch to the webid branch
  $ hg clone https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/read-write-web
  $ cd read-write-web
  $ hg checkout webid

1. download java 6 or above for your Operating System - don't download just the JRE but also the java tools

2. download scala http://www.scala-lang.org/

3. download the scala build tool ( sbt ) from https://github.com/harrah/xsbt 
   I have an xsbt shell script that contains
    java $SBT_PROPS -Xmx512m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -jar `dirname $0`/jars/sbt-launch-0.11.0.jar "$@"

4. set up some environmental variables for the https server to run on

 export SBT_PROPS='-Djetty.ssl.keyStoreType=JKS -Djetty.ssl.keyStore=keys/KEYSTORE.jks -Djetty.ssl.keyStorePassword=secret'  

  Notice if you want to avoid browser warnings and you want to put this up on a public site then you need to get a CA signed certificate for your domain. There are providers that give those for free. There are protocols that will appear to make this no longer necessary

5. run sbt, then start the server from the command line

  $ sbt
  >  run --https 8443 test_www /2011/09

  This will compile the server, start the https port on 8442 and use files in the test_www directory so that you can access them at https://localhost:8443/2011/09/

6. connect to different resources

 $ curl -k https://localhost:8443/public/ 
  If you access this via your browser and you have more than one webid certificate, your browser will ask you for  even when you access this. We are working on a solution to stop this from happening.

The following is a protected resource so if you access it without authentification credentials you will get  

 $  curl  -i -k https://localhost:8443/2011/09/foaf.n3
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Length: 0
Server: Jetty(7.2.2.v20101205)
   
If you have a WebID enabled certificate ( http://webid.info/ ) with the public and private keys in a pem file, then you can access the resource with, 

 $ curl -E Certificates.pem -i -k https://localhost:8443/2011/09/foaf.n3

since only Henry Story can view it as seen from the file

  $ cat test_www/foaf.n3.protect.n3 

@prefix acl: <http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#> .
@prefix : <#> .

:a1 a acl:Authorization;
   acl:accessTo <foaf.n3>;
   acl:mode acl:Read;
   acl:agent <http://bblfish.net/people/henry/card#me> .

If you want to give yourself access then replace Henry's WebID, "http://bblfish.net/people/henry/card#me"  with your own, or make another example for that.

More interesting examples to follow soon.
